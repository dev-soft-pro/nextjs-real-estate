        <strong>Registration</strong>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        You are not required to register for a TopHap account to see complete
        home listings. However, even unregistered Users are bound by the terms
        and conditions of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Users may choose to register for a TopHap account in order to avail
        themselves of enhanced services and features provided by the Company. By
        registering for a TopHap account you are, among other things, also

        related to the Services that occur through your account. It is your

        <strong>Registered Accounts</strong>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Trial Period</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Users who register for an account will automatically receive a free
        trial period (at no charge) for a defined period of time (“Trial
        Period”). Both the exact length of the Trial Period (e.g. two weeks, one
        month, etc.) as well as the consequences of Trial Expiration will be
        indicated to the User at the time of registration. Only one Trial Period
        will be offered to any particular User. No User is eligible for more
        than one Trial Period, and the same User may not obtain additional Trial
        Periods by re-registering for duplicate accounts.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        The Company reserves the right to change, modify, alter or discontinue
        the length of the Trial Period in its sole and absolute discretion. The
        Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, offer differing Trial
        Periods from time to time.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Expiration of Trial Period</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        When the applicable Trial Period expires (“Trial Expiration”), the
        registered account will then either: (a) if the User did not provide the
        User’s payment information at the time of registration or prior to the
        time of Trial Expiration, then the account shall automatically expire
        and the User’s access to such account will be permanently discontinued
        unless the User elects to instead become a paying subscriber by
        providing TopHap with the necessary payment information at or prior to
        the time of Trial Expiration; or (b) if the User previously provided
        TopHap with payment information at the time of registration or prior to
        the time of Trial Expiration, then the account shall automatically
        convert into a paid subscription account and the User will be charged
        the recurring subscription fee as of the time of the Trial Expiration.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <strong>Account Billing and Payments</strong>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        The following information in this section entitled “Account Billing and
        Payments” applies to Users who register for an account and then become
        paying subscribers for TopHap services.
        <strong />
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Monthly Subscription(s)</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        The Company charges every registered User a monthly subscription fee of
        $ <u>49.95</u> (Forty-Nine Dollars and Ninety-Five Cents) for access to
        the TopHap account and associated features and services. The fee is
        charged in advance in respect of each monthly period (i.e. a fee charged
        today to a User applies to, and covers, the following monthly period).
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Recurring Fee</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Once the subscription fee is first charged to a particular User, the fee
        is then automatically charged to that particular User every month (or
        every year, in the case of an annual subscription) on each successive
        monthly anniversary date (or yearly anniversary date in the case of an
        annual subscription) of the first payment. If any payment date falls on
        a holiday or weekend, the Company may (in its sole and absolute
        discretion) charge the subscription fee on the business day that is
        immediately preceding (or following) the holiday or weekend dates. The
        subscription fee shall be recurring, with no end date, until such time
        as the User’s account is terminated or cancelled.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Annual Option</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        The Company may choose, in its sole and absolute discretion, to offer
        Users the option to pay their subscription fees in advance for an entire
        annual period (i.e. in lieu of twelve (12) monthly payments, the User
        would make one single, lump-sum payment in advance to cover the entirety
        of the next annual period of twelve (12) months). In the event that such
        an annual payment option is offered to Users, the Company may set the
        cost for such an annual subscription in its sole and absolute discretion
        (and such annual subscription cost may or may not present an aggregate
        discount to the monthly subscription fee).
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        The annual subscription fee is charged in advance in respect of each
        annual period (i.e. a fee charged today to a User applies to, and
        covers, the following annual period).
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Billing Cycle(s)</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        As discussed above, we automatically bill you each month (or each year,
        in the case of annual subscriptions) on the calendar day corresponding
        to the date on which you first commenced payment for the subscription.
        Although TopHap endeavors to bill you as described herein above, we
        reserve the right to change the timing of billing as necessary, from
        time to time, and at any time in our sole and absolute discretion.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Account fees are fully earned upon payment. You must pay undisputed
        portions of any billing statement when due. In the event of your
        non-payment by the applicable due date, TopHap may elect (in its sole
        and absolute discretion) to immediately limit or suspend (temporarily)
        or terminate (permanently) your access and use (in whole or in part) of
        your account. Such suspension or termination of your account shall be
        without limitation to any and all other rights or remedies available to
        TopHap at law, in equity, under contract (including this Agreement), or
        otherwise, all of which are hereby expressly and fully reserved.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Changes to Subscription Fee</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        TopHap may, from time to time and at any time in its sole and absolute
        discretion, change or modify the amount of, or the basis for,
        determining any fees or charges to Users. Any such changes to the amount
        of the subscription fee will be electronically communicated to Users.
        The modified fee amount will thereafter take effect on the next monthly
        payment date (or annual payment date, in the case of yearly
        subscriptions).
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Billing Information</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Charges are billed to the credit or debit card provided by a User
        through their TopHap account. You agree to pay all such amounts billed.
        You are also separately responsible for the payment of any and all
        taxes, fees, and other charges, if any, that are now or may in the
        future be assessed in connection with your access or use of your TopHap
        account.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Please be advised that State and local taxes, or reimbursement charges
        for gross earnings taxes, may apply in certain jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        All payments are to be made directly by Users to TopHap, unless TopHap
        expressly authorizes otherwise. TopHap shall have no obligation
        whatsoever to provide any accounts, services, features or functionality
        for any accounts for which payment is made by a User to a third party or
        for which payment is made by a third party on a User’s behalf.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        The Company does not provide paper bills. The Company may choose, in its
        sole and absolute discretion, to provide electronic statements to Users.
        However, the failure to receive a bill or statement, whether a paper
        bill or an electronic statement, does not release or relieve you from
        your payment obligations under this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Late Payments</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        In the event of any late payments by a User, TopHap may unilaterally
        terminate, limit or suspend that User’s account (with or without notice)
        for any such failure to timely pay any amounts by the required due date.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Registration of Credit or Debit Card</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Users are required to register a valid credit or debit card to process
        payments of the associated fees. When you register your credit or debit
        card for your account, you expressly authorize TopHap to place a pending
        charge to the credit or debit card to verify your billing address and
        the validity of your credit or debit card. These pending charges are
        temporary and will not be converted into an actual charge to you.
        However, please note that pending charges, while pending, will typically
        reduce the amount of credit available to you for use on your credit or
        debit card. Once your credit or debit card information is authenticated,
        the credit or debit card that Customer registered with your TopHap
        account will then be automatically charged for each transaction without
        having to reenter or verify that same credit or debit card information
        again.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        You are solely responsible and liable for any and all fees charged to
        you by your credit or debit card and the card’s issuer, bank, or
        financial institution, including (without limitation) fees for
        membership, any overdraft or insufficient funds, or for exceeding any
        applicable credit limit).
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        You expressly represent, warrant, agree and authorize that the issuer of
        any credit or debit card that you register in your TopHap account will:
        (a) accept the billing and payment terms and conditions of this
        Agreement, (b) pay any and all amounts due on your behalf and that are
        billed in connection with your TopHap account and (c) make any and all
        payments due on your behalf without the Company needing to submit a
        signed receipt or proof of your signature.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Credit/Debit Cards</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        You agree to provide TopHap with updated credit or debit card
        information upon request and also any time the information you
        previously provided is no longer valid. You are solely responsible for
        maintaining and updating your credit or debit card information.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Without limiting the applicability of any other provisions of this
        Agreement, you expressly acknowledge and agree that TopHap will not have
        any liability whatsoever for any non-sufficient funds or other charges
        incurred by you as a result of our attempts to charge, and/or place
        holds on, your credit or debit card.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Billing Errors</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        If you believe that you have been billed in error, you must contact us
        immediately, and in no event more than thirty (30) days following the
        date you are erroneously billed. Failure by you to timely notify TopHap
        of any billing dispute will constitute your acceptance of the
        corresponding billed amounts, and you agree to waive any future claims
        that such billed amount(s) are, or were ever, in error.

        COMPENSATION OR OTHER FORM OF RECOMPENSE (AND REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS OR
        THEORY OF YOUR CLAIM FOR CREDIT, REFUND, RETURN, PRICE ADJUSTMENT, OTHER
        DISCOUNT, COMPENSATION OR FORM OF RECOMPENSE). WITHOUT LIMITATION TO THE
        FOREGOING, TOPHAP FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL FORMS OF
        LIABILITY FOR ANY CREDIT, REFUND, RETURN, PRICE ADJUSTMENT, OTHER
        DISCOUNT, COMPENSATION OR FORM OF RECOMPENSE FOR ANY CLAIMS THAT A USER
        ONLY PARTIALLY USED THE ACCOUNT SERVICES OR DID NOT FULLY DOWNLOAD OR
        VIEW SERVICES, FEATURES OR FUNTIONALITY OF THE TOPHAP ACCOUNT.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Although not required or obligated (as explained above), TopHap reserves
        the right to evaluate or elect to provide credits, refunds, price
        adjustments or other discounts, compensation or form(s) of recompense,
        from time to time, and at any time, in its sole and absolute discretion;{' '}
        <u>provided,</u> that any such elections to offer any such credits,
        refund, price adjustments or other discounts, compensation or form(s) of
        recompense in any one instance or situation does not entitle any User to
        the same or any such benefit in the future for similar or unrelated
        instances or situations, nor does it create any obligation whatsoever
        for TopHap to offer such benefit to any User in connection with or
        relating to any past, present, or future requests for the same under any
        circumstance(s) whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        You hereby authorize TopHap to use outside payment processing agencies
        or other companies for purposes of paying any refund owed to you. You
        also agree that TopHap may determine, in its sole and absolute
        discretion, the form and manner of any refund that TopHap may choose to
        issue to you, and that such form or manner of refund may include
        (without limitation) account or billing credits for past or future
        TopHap services, a cash payment by check, a credit to a User’s debit or
        credit card account, or a prepaid debit card.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Any amounts refunded by TopHap shall, at TopHap’s sole election,
        normally be issued in the form of TopHap credits for past billing or a
        TopHap credit against future bills for account services (i.e. such
        credits will not normally take the form of cash refunds or credits
        directly applied to the User’s credit or debit card). TopHap reserves
        the right (in its sole and absolute discretion) to issue cash payments
        (or credits applied to credit or debit cards), but makes no guarantees
        or promises that that the Company will issue cash payments (or credits
        applied to credit or debit cards) in any particular instance.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Refunds, whether consisting of billing credits or cash payments or any
        other form of refund, shall be inclusive of all applicable taxes, fees
        and surcharges that were originally paid on such amounts. Credit amounts
        that do not represent a refund of, or a discount to, the price paid for
        any service will not result in the refund of any tax, fee, or surcharge
        previously paid.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Subscription Termination by the User</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        A subscription may be terminated at any time by the User by electing
        such termination through the user administration console within the
        User’s TopHap account. The termination, once elected, will be
        automatically effective at the end of the then-current subscription term
        (i.e. at the end of the subscription month or year during which
        termination is elected). Any and all fees due to TopHap as of, and at,
        the effective date of termination shall nevertheless be deemed to have
        been fully earned by the Company. You are liable and responsible for any
        and all fees and charges up and through the date that voluntary
        termination of your account is effective.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Suspension or Termination by TopHap</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        As discussed herein above, accounts and subscriptions may be terminated
        if any payment owed to the Company is past due. TopHap may also limit,
        suspend or terminate services and accounts of any User if it is
        determined by TopHap (in its sole and absolute discretion) that there is
        any previously unpaid, undisputed, and/or outstanding amounts due to the
        Company from the User.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        In the event of TopHap limiting, suspending or terminating a User’s
        subscription or account, such limitation, suspension or termination (as
        applicable) shall typically continue until satisfactory arrangements
        have been made for the payment of any and all past unpaid charges and
        fees then-owning to TopHap. While an account or subscription is
        suspended, the User may have no use of the User’s account and any of its
        services, features or functions.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        TopHap may also immediately terminate, limit or suspend any User account
        or subscription (in whole or in part), with or without notice, for User
        conduct that TopHap believes, in its sole and absolute discretion, is
        (a) illegal, fraudulent, harassing, abusive, or intended to intimidate
        or threaten; (b) a violation of any law, regulation, or tariff
        (including, without limitation, copyright and intellectual property
        laws), or (c) a violation of this Agreement, or any of TopHap’s policies
        or guidelines (including, but not limited to, the Company’s Privacy
        Policy).
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Restarting Subscription Services</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        In the event that TopHap limits, suspends or terminates any User’s
        account or subscription for any reason whatsoever under this Agreement,
        TopHap is in no way obligated (directly or indirectly) to reestablish
        such User’s account, access to services or subscription.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        TopHap may require such User to pay, and such User must then pay, a fee
        to restart the User’s account services and subscription. Any such
        restart fee payable by the User shall be in addition to any and all
        amounts past due amounts and charges (if any) hereunder that the User
        shall also responsible to pay before TopHap reestablishes the User’s
        account and subscription.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Without limiting the foregoing, TopHap may also require certain Users,
        whose accounts were limited, suspended and/or terminated on account of
        lack of payment or similar non-performance, to make an additional
        reasonable deposit of fees in advance to cover future User expenses and
        to protect TopHap from the risk of loss, non-payment or other similar
        User issues. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, any such
        advance deposits will not be held segregated from other funds and will
        not earn or accrue any interest.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <em>Collections</em>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        TopHap may utilize, in its sole and absolute discretion, one or more
        attorneys or collection agencies to assist TopHap in collecting any
        outstanding monies that Users may owe to TopHap or to assert any other
        right that TopHap may have against Users (e.g. any breach of this
        Agreement). You hereby agree to pay and be liable for any and all of the
        reasonable costs of such collection efforts or actions. These costs may
        include, without limitation, the costs of a collection agency,
        reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs and reasonable out-of-pocket
        expenses.

        will fully cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses, and
        promptly reimburse our reasonable costs and expenses (including, without
        limitation, reasonable attorney and professional fees) in connection
        with, relating to or arising from our defense in such matter. No
        settlement, compromise or adjudication of any Claim to which indemnity
        applies hereunder, shall be effective or permitted without the express
        and prior written consent of the Company.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>Changes or Specialized Modifications</p>
      <p>
        The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, modify or change
        any aspect of the Agreement at any time, in whole or in part and with or
        without prior notice to you. Please consult the end of this Agreement to
        determine when the Agreement was last revised. You agree to periodically
        review this Agreement to ensure that you are in compliance with any
        ongoing changes or modifications that are made to the Agreement. Your

        The Company reserves the right to modify the Agreement as it applies to
        any specific user, provided that any and all such special modifications

      <p align='left'>Term and Termination</p>
      <p align='left'>
        This Agreement becomes effective and constitutes a binding legal

      </p>

        The Company may, at any time, in its sole and absolute discretion,
        terminate this Agreement with you and your access to the Site with or
        without notice to you and for any reason or no reason; provided that

        upon your breach of any of the terms of this Agreement.
      </p>

        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Governing Law</u>: This Policy shall be governed by and construed in
        accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to
        the conflicts of law provisions thereof. The parties agree that the
        United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
        Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act shall not
        apply to the Agreement.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Informal Negotiations</u>: To expedite resolution and reduce the cost
        of any dispute, controversy or claim arising between you and TopHap, you
        and TopHap agree to first attempt to negotiate informally for at least
        thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.
        Such informal negotiations will commence upon notice from one party to
        the other party.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        If necessary to preserve a claim under any applicable statute of
        limitations, you or TopHap may initiate arbitration while engaging in
        the above-referenced informal negotiations.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Mandatory Arbitration</u>: You expressly agree that any controversy,
        dispute or claim arising out of, relating to, or in connection with,
        this Agreement or the alleged breach thereof, or relating to our
        activities or services or to us otherwise under this Agreement, shall be
        resolved by confidential binding arbitration in the county and State in
        which the Company maintains its principal place of business. You and the
        Company shall bear equally the costs of any such arbitration. The
        arbitration shall be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator. The
        arbitrator shall issue a written decision that contains the essential
        findings and conclusions on which the decision is based. Judgment on any
        award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be binding on the parties and
        may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Waivers</u>: Except as noted below, to the fullest extent permitted
        by law, you and TopHap agree that no class, collective, aggregate, or
        representative actions can be asserted in arbitration, litigation, or
        otherwise (“Class Action Waiver”). All claims must be brought solely in
        your or TopHap’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class
        member in any purported class, representative, aggregated, or collective
        proceeding. Furthermore, you expressly understand and waive your right
        to trial by a jury.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
        REGARD TO CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
        PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PARTIES FURTHER WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO
        PURSUE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AGGREGATE, OR
        REPRESENTATIVE ACTION PERTAINING TO ANY SUCH CLAIMS BETWEEN THEM.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        If the Class Action Waiver, or any other provision requiring that claims
        be brought only on an individual basis and not on a class, collective,
        or representative basis, is determined to be invalid or unenforceable
        with respect to any particular claim, then that claim shall not proceed
        in arbitration but rather will be resolved in a court of competent
        jurisdiction. If that happens, however, the arbitration provisions in
        this Agreement will still be fully enforceable as to all other claims,
        which must be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis. Any
        arbitrable claims will be resolved before non-arbitrable claims, which
        the parties shall jointly request to be stayed pending the conclusion of
        arbitration.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Equitable Relief:</u>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions regarding arbitration, the
        agreement to arbitration set forth above does not limit the ability of
        the parties to apply for equitable relief (including, but not limited
        to, an injunction) to a court of competent jurisdiction, including (but
        not limited to) enforcing the arbitration provisions hereof. Without
        limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge that violations or breaches of
        this Agreement by you may cause the Company irreparable harm, and the
        parties agree that the Company may petition any court of competent
        jurisdiction worldwide for equitable relief (including, but not limited
        to, injunctive relief), without the need to post any bond, in addition
        to all other remedies available at law or equity. Remedies under this
        Agreement are cumulative and may be enforced singularly or together at
        any time otherwise permitted. Any requests for injunctive or declaratory
        relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful
        acts that threaten future injury to the general public, the entitlement
        and extent of such relief may be litigated in a civil court of competent
        jurisdiction and not in arbitration; provided, that the parties agree
        that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be
        stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in
        arbitration.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Attorney’s Fees and Costs</u>: The prevailing party in any
        controversy or dispute arising hereunder shall be entitled to recovery
        of its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs from the controversy or
        dispute as provided herein.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <strong>Remedies</strong>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        If you are dissatisfied for any reason with the Site, or the terms and
        conditions of this Agreement or the Privacy Policy, your sole and
        exclusive remedy (whether at law or equity) shall be to discontinue your
        use of the Site and terminate this Agreement as described herein.
        <strong />
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        You hereby expressly agree that during the term of this Agreement and
        for a period of one (1) year thereafter, you will not, directly or
        indirectly, attempt to or actually circumvent this Agreement or its
        purpose or intent.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        The Company will not be liable for any failure to perform acts due to
        causes beyond its control (including, without limitation, electrical
        outage, Internet Service Provider or wireless network or other service
        provider downtime, power failure, fire, flood, strike, civil
        disturbance, terrorism, war or Acts of God). If any such circumstances
        occur, Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to
        provide reasonable notice to you of the same. The time for Company to
        perform hereunder will be extended for a period of time equal to the
        duration of the delay or default caused thereby.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Entire Agreement</u>: This Agreement (together with the Privacy
        Policy) contains the entire, complete and exclusive understanding
        between Company and you with respect to the subject matter hereof and
        supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements or
        understandings (whether oral, written, implied or otherwise, or whether
        established by custom, practice, policy or precedent) between the
        parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may
        apply when you use or receive certain TopHap services.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Amendments</u>: Except as provided in the paragraph titled “Changes
        or Specialized Modifications” above, any modification, addendum, or
        amendment to this Agreement will not be effective unless the same is in
        writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of Company. This
        Agreement may not be modified, supplemented or amended by an electronic
        signature (or electronic correspondence) from Company.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        The Company reserves the right to modify, supplement, or replace the
        terms of this Agreement. We may choose, in our sole discretion, to
        notify you in advance of any material changes to the Agreement before
        they take effect so that you can decide whether to continue using the
        Site. If you do not want to agree to such material changes to this
        Agreement before the changes take effect, you can terminate this
        Agreement at any time as provided herein.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Severability</u>: If any provision of this Agreement is found by a
        court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be illegal, void, or
        unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be modified so as to
        render it enforceable and effective to the maximum extent possible in
        order to effect the intention of the provision.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Waiver</u>: Failure by a party to enforce any right, remedy or
        provision hereof will not be deemed a waiver of the same or any future
        enforcement of that or any other right, remedy or provision. A waiver by
        a party of any right, remedy or provision hereof shall only be effective
        if it is in an express waiver thereof.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Time Limit on Claims</u>: Regardless of any statute or law to the
        contrary, any claim or cause of action that you have that arises out of
        or is related to the use of the Site or this Agreement must be filed by
        you within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be
        forever barred.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Notices</u>: Unless otherwise stated herein, any notices hereunder to
        Company shall be in writing and be delivered by hand or mail (as

        the other party by delivering notice of such change pursuant to this
        paragraph.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Acceptance</u>: Your written or electronic signature is not necessary
        to manifest your assent or acceptance of this Agreement, and your use of
        the Site (as discussed herein) shall in and of itself constitute such
        assent and acceptance. This Agreement may be accepted and executed in
        the manner provided herein and such acceptance as provided herein shall
        constitute a valid and legally binding agreement between the parties.
      </p>

        <u>Binding Authority</u>: By agreeing to the terms and conditions of
        this Agreement (including, but not limited to, by a click-through or

      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        <u>Assignment</u>: Neither this Agreement, nor any rights or obligations

        or in part) by you without the prior express written consent of Company.
        Any attempted assignment, delegation or transfer by you in violation of
        this paragraph shall be null and void <em>ab initio</em>. This Agreement
        will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
        their respective successors, heirs, executors and permitted assigns. The
        Company may freely assign or transfer (in whole or in part) this

        hereunder) with or without notice thereof to you. The Company may also
        substitute, by way of unilateral novation, effective upon notice to you,
        any third party that assumes our rights and obligations under this
        Agreement.

      <p align='left'>
        <u>Relationship</u>: Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to
        constitute an agency, partnership, joint venture or employer-employee

        not hold itself out as having the power, to act for or in the name of,

        be construed to give either party the power to direct or control the
        day-to-day activities of the other party. The provisions of this
        Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of Company and you, and
        shall create no rights or obligations enforceable by any other party.
