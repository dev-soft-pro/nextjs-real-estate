      <h1>We Bring Clarity To Real Estate Decisions</h1>

      <p>
        <b>What we do:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        TopHap is a real estate technology company that makes investor-grade
        analytics easy, intuitive, and accessible to everyone. We pull the
        curtain back and show you what makes real estate worth what it’s worth
        and empower the smartest real estate agents, investors, buyers, and
        sellers to make intelligent, data-driven real estate purchase and
        selling decisions. We utilize machine learning (ML) to visualize
        residential real estate market trends, conditions and neighborhood
        characteristics. We offer the most user-friendly and accurate way to
        evaluate and compare real estate opportunities. TopHap harnesses the
        power of modern analytics to build confidence in your real estate
        strategy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Why we do it:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        In one word, TRUST. TopHap aims to bring trust, transparency, and
        confidence to the largest financial decision a person will likely make
        in their lifetime. Few decisions of such magnitude in life depend on
        such limited information. We believe that the importance of this
        decision demands investor-grade tools, modern data and visualization,
        and strong analytics. Whether you’re a real estate professional or a
        private buyer or seller, you deserve a tool that removes the guesswork
        from your real estate research and analysis process. We at TopHap
        believe that everyone deserves the best information and the tools to
        understand it.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>How we do it:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        We have compiled the most comprehensive collection of public and
        proprietary data ever to be integrated into one real estate platform and
        apply state of the art ML and visualization techniques to deliver the
        most robust and accurate real estate assessment tools in the industry.
        We combine residential real estate data with macro-economic,
        environmental, geographic, census, construction and local commercial
        data, and much more to derive insights and correlations that power our
        valuation engine and market assessment tools. This enables TopHap users
        to understand the conditions that drive their own real estate investing
        decisions. With the integration of these different data sets, we are
        able to derive the attributes that have driven historical value and
        forecast attributes that will drive future value. No other real estate
        platform has been able to deliver this visibility and precision in one
        solution.

        <b>What we believe:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        We at TopHap believe it’s time for the Real Estate industry to evolve
        and embrace the technological advances we have seen in so many other
        industries. Every business is increasingly powered by data and
        analytics. We believe the Real Estate industry requires the same. The
        scale and importance of a real estate decision is profound, and the
        industry needs to harness the power of modern data and analytics to meet
        the growing needs and expectations of our clients. We have an abundance
        of real estate related data all around us, but too little is used in our
        real estate decision-making process because it’s inaccessible or hard to
        interpret. We believe real estate professionals and consumers deserve a
        truly innovative set of research and analysis tools. We can help people
        remove the guesswork and greatly improve the quality of their analysis
        so they can make better real estate decisions. If we do this, we can
        unlock the transparency and trust our industry needs and deserves.
