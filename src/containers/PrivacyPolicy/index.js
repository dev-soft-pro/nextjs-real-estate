      <p>
        Registered users of the Site should also be mindful of the following
        considerations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Account Profile</u>: You will typically be able to save searches,
          add favorites and x-outs, and otherwise organize homes that may be of
          interest to you. We save all of this information in your Account
          Profile for your use later. It is stored with your account
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Account Password Security</u>: Your TopHap account password is
          encrypted on our server and is known only to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Account Updates</u>: By visiting the Account Settings section for
          your account, you can correct, amend, add or delete personal
          information associated with your account. However, even after you
          update information, we may continue to maintain a copy of the original
          (prior) information in our records.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>General: Disclosure of Personal Information</p>
      <p align='left'>
        Your information may be disclosed to: (a) our employees, agents,
        representatives, advisors, affiliates and independent contractors, in
        connection with their performance of services for or on behalf of the
        Company; and (b) service providers who help us with our business
        operations, sales and marketing, information technology or professional
        services. We will take commercially reasonable measures to ensure that
        your information collected, used, disclosed or otherwise processed by
        any of the aforementioned parties for us or on our behalf is protected
        and not used or disclosed for purposes other than as directed by the
        Company.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        We do not generally sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside
        parties your personal information. However, the preceding statement does
        not apply to trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Site,
        conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties
        agree to keep this information confidential. For example, and without
        limitation, the Company may freely disclose your personal information to
        third party service providers under conditions of confidentiality in
        order to administer our Site or to improve the functionality of our
        services. These third-party service providers may include (without
        limitation) auditors, hosting providers, Internet Service Providers,
        software providers, information technology service providers, server and
        data providers, and e-mail validation services.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may disclose your personal information
        without any restrictions thereof: (a) with your consent; (b) as is
        required under applicable law to meet legal, regulatory, insurance,
        audit, and security requirements; (b) pursuant to a subpoena or other
        legal action; (c) where we reasonably believe that disclosure is
        necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
        illegal activities or suspected situations involving potential threats
        to the property rights or physical safety of any person; (d) in
        connection with the contemplated or actual financing, securitization,
        insuring, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of the
        Company or our business or assets, including (without limitation) for
        the purposes of permitting counter-parties to determine whether or not
        to proceed or continue with any such transaction (provided, that in the
        event that all or part of the Company or our business or assets is sold,
        assigned or otherwise disposed of, personal information that we have
        collected will be disclosed by such parties for substantially the same
        purposes as described in the Privacy Policy); or (e) in the event of a
        violation of our Privacy Policy or our terms of use of service regarding
        the Site.
      </p>
      <p>Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
      <p>
        We share and disclose information depending on your level of engagement
        with the Site. The higher the level of your participation, the more
        information (and the greater the scope of disclosure of that
        information) that may be shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below we explain the types of information that we share and our
        disclosure of information for people who engage with the Site or
        otherwise participate in services offered by TopHap (including all Users
        and our Registered Site Users (including Registered App Users)):
      </p>
      <p>
        We may occasionally share your information with other companies for
        purposes of marketing TopHap products or services that may be of
        interest to you. In order to determine the types of information that may
        be of interest to you, we may combine the information that you give us
        (and information about your usage of the Site) with other personally
        identifiable information (such as demographic information and past
        purchase history) available from our records and other sources. Please
        note that if you follow a link on our Site to a third-party website,
        that particular third-party’s applicable privacy policy then governs the
        collection and use of information that you may provide on that site.
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to information regarding home sales and purchases, Users
        should also be mindful of the following considerations:
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Public Record Information</u>: We post on the Site some information
        that typically becomes part of the public record of a home sale or
        purchase. Please be aware that home sales and purchases are a matter of
        public record, and your name and address, the price you paid or
        received, your property taxes, and other information will be available
        from public sites regardless of the brokerage(s), if any, who assist in
        the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Non-Public Record Information</u>: We may also share information
        obtained from you that is not part of the public record.
      </p>
      <p>Consent</p>
      <p align='left'>
        Consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information may be
        given in various ways. Consent can be express (for example, orally,
        electronically, via text message or on a form you may sign describing
        the intended uses and disclosures of your information) or implied (for
        example, and without limitation, when you provide information necessary
        for a user access or access credentials that you have requested) or
        given in some circumstances where notice has been provided to you about
        our intentions with respect to your personal information and you have
        not withdrawn your consent for an identified purpose, such as by using
        an "opt out" option provided, if any.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Consent may also be given by your authorized representative (such as,
        for example and without limitation, a legal guardian or a person having
        a power of attorney). Generally, by providing us with personal
        information, we will assume that you consent to our collection, use and
        disclosure of such information for the purposes identified or described
        in the Privacy Policy, if applicable, or otherwise at the time of
        collection. You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use and
        disclosure of personal information at any time by contacting us as
        indicated below, subject to contractual and legal restrictions and
        reasonable notice. Please note that if you withdraw your consent to
        certain uses of your personal information then we may no longer be able
        to provide you with certain of our products or services.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Each User is deemed to consent to receiving periodic email, text and
        other electronic or digital messages from the Company, unless the User
        has expressed a desire to unsubscribe and not receive such messages. The
        email messages may include, without limitation, information and
        advertisements from the Company and its partners. The Company will

      <p align='left'>
        The Company collects, utilizes and discloses your information with your
        consent, except as is otherwise permitted or required by law or set
        forth in this Policy. We may also be required or permitted under statute
        or regulation to collect, use or disclose personal information without
        your consent, for example (and without limitation) to comply with a
        court order, to comply with local, federal or foreign regulations or a
        legally permitted inquiry by a government agency, or to collect a debt
        owed to us.
      </p>
      <p align='left'>
        Please bear in mind that the Company is based in the United States, and
        we do not necessarily attempt to comply with foreign (non-U.S.) privacy
        legislation. By consenting (in any manner described above) to our
        collection, usage and disclosure of your information, you acknowledge
        and understand that the Site may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the
        world, and furthermore, you agree that your personal information may be
        transferred across international boundaries.
